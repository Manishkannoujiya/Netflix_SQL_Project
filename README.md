## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Netflix’s content dataset using Structured Query Language (SQL) to extract actionable insights. The dataset includes detailed information about movies and TV shows available on the Netflix platform, such as titles, genres, cast, release year, country, duration, and type of content.

## Objective 
The objective of this project is to leverage SQL for a comprehensive analysis of Netflix’s content dataset to uncover meaningful insights that can inform strategic decisions. Specifically, the project aims to:

Classify and quantify the distribution of content types (movies vs. TV shows) on Netflix

Analyze genre popularity to identify viewer content preferences

Examine temporal trends in content releases over the years

Assess the geographic diversity of Netflix’s catalog by analyzing country-wise content distribution

Identify top actors, directors, and creators frequently featured on the platform

Investigate duration trends to understand typical content lengths for both movies and series

Build efficient, reusable, and optimized SQL queries for scalable data exploration

By achieving these objectives, the project intends to help stakeholders better understand Netflix’s content portfolio, identify opportunities for content curation, and support data-driven content strategy decisions.
