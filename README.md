## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Netflix’s content dataset using Structured Query Language (SQL) to extract actionable insights. The dataset includes detailed information about movies and TV shows available on the Netflix platform, such as titles, genres, cast, release year, country, duration, and type of content.

## Objective 
The objective of this project is to leverage SQL for a comprehensive analysis of Netflix’s content dataset to uncover meaningful insights that can inform strategic decisions. Specifically, the project aims to:

* Classify and quantify the distribution of content types (movies vs. TV shows) on Netflix

* Analyze genre popularity to identify viewer content preferences

* Examine temporal trends in content releases over the years

* Assess the geographic diversity of Netflix’s catalog by analyzing country-wise content distribution

* Identify top actors, directors, and creators frequently featured on the platform

* Investigate duration trends to understand typical content lengths for both movies and series

* Build efficient, reusable, and optimized SQL queries for scalable data exploration

By achieving these objectives, the project intends to help stakeholders better understand Netflix’s content portfolio, identify opportunities for content curation, and support data-driven content strategy decisions.

## Conclusions
Through the systematic use of SQL-based data analysis, the project concludes that Netflix has maintained a broad and diverse catalog with a strategic emphasis on movie content. The platform continues to invest in drama,comedy,horror,Sci-Fi,romantic action & adventure etc. genres
The patterns in release years demonstrate Netflix’s push for content growth in recent years, while the consistent duration patterns reflect alignment with conventional viewer habits. Overall, these insights highlight Netflix’s successful efforts to balance global reach with targeted genre investments, providing a data-backed perspective on its evolving content strategy.
